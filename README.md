# Graphs_project
  This is a project written using c#, it is an implementation of various algorithms to solve some problems connected to graphs.
 
  The main goal was, to create an app that is using Form in c# through which we can add nodes and edges that are connecting those nodes, and later use advanced features. So, it has a way to add previously created graphs from a file, because a user can save created graphs in a file when he is done with creating it. 
  
  In the app, there are impemented Prim's and Dijkstra's alghoritm.
